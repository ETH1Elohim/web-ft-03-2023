Consider the following. We want to make a pizza.
// We make the dough independently.
// We make the sauce independently.
// We want to be able to taste the sauce, before we decide what kind of cheese is
going to work best on the pizza.


1. dough complete 
2. sauce complete -> taste
3. last is cheese based on taste of sauce

async function makePizza(){
 //   if(dough == 'complete'){
//        await makeDough()
//    }

    makeSauce()
    await graidCheese()


}
